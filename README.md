# Crack-Stress-Thresholds
This GUI provides an alternative intelligent and non-destructive approach using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to predict the UCS, elastic modulus, and crack stress thresholds (i.e., crack closure stress, crack initiation stress, and crack damage stress) of intact rock specimens. The model has been developed based on a comprehensive database including different rock types (i.e., sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks). 

However, it should be noted that the performance of the developed RF models is contingent upon the data falling within the bounds of the input and output specified parameters (i.e., minimum-maximum ranges) used during their development. For prospective applications, it is essential to adhere to the prescribed ranges to achieve optimal results. However, by accumulating more extensive and diverse data in future endeavours, the boundaries of input variables can be expanded, and the proposed models can be updated to render more universal predictive models.
