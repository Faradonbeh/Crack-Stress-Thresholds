# Crack-Stress-Thresholds
This GUI provides an alternative intelligent and non-destructive approachs uisng Random Forest (RF) algorithm to predict the UCS, elastic modulus, and crack stress thresholds (i.e., crack closure stress, crack initiation stress, and crack damage stress) of intact rock specimens. The models covers a wide range of rock types.
