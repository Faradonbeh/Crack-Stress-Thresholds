# Crack-Stress-Thresholds
This GUI provides an alternative intelligent and non-destructive approach using Random Forest (RF) algorithm to predict the UCS, elastic modulus, and crack stress thresholds (i.e., crack closure stress, crack initiation stress, and crack damage stress) of intact rock specimens. The model covers a wide range of rock types. For more information, please refer to the below link.

To run the model, download the "RF-GUI.zip" file from the "Releases" section, extract all materials, and click on "main.exe".
